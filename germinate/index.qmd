## 1. Before you start
Our goal with this manual is to help you understand how to prepare and import your experimental data effectively enabling your research outputs to be accessible and integrated within the COUSIN stakeholders via Germinate.
This guide does not cover all features of Germinate. Instead, it provides step-by-step instructions tailored to ensure you can successfully complete the official project’s upload templates with your COUSIN-related datasets and then make it available to the Germinate audience.

Before you start, we expect that you are already familiar with concept of Germinate platform and its general purpose regarding COUSIN project targets. 

::: {.callout-tip}
If you are interested in a fully training on Germinate, an official training resource is available <a href="https://germinateplatform.github.io/germinate-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.

## 2.	Template Files
COUSIN’s Germinate supports data uploads using specific Excel templates, along with a few options for text-based data templates and even images uploads. Detailed information on how to correctly complete these templates is available within the **Data Uploader** section, located under the **User Advanced Settings** menu. This feature (Upload Data) is accessible to users <u>with the appropriate upload permissions</u> . Additionally, a [direct link](https://cousin.ipk-gatersleben.de/templates) to the templates can be found in the Data Resources link, providing <u>easy access for any user</u>. The templates are store together with other data resources of the project but with this link they are filtered among the others.
Users with the Curator role are authorized to upload data into COUSIN's Germinate platform. However, before gaining upload permissions, interested users must be designated by the project's work package leaders and complete a training session on the data upload process. The WP5 team is always available to support and assist with data curation and the entire upload process whenever needed, ensuring accurate data management.

### 2.1	Downloading the templates

  </figure>

  <!-- Texte à côté -->
  <div>
  Even being a regular user, you being a regular user, you have access to the Data resources and Templates. The easiest way to access it is through the following URL:

  <a href="https://cousin.ipk-gatersleben.de/templates" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cousin.ipk-gatersleben.de/templates</a>

  This URL will redirect you directly to the importation templates (see Figure 5).

  Other way to reach the templates is by clicking the left menu, **Section Data**, subpage **Data Resources**.

  Note that by accessing Data Resources page you will be presented to all type of data resources already available among the project scope. By going this way, the importation templates will be available and you can download it.

  It’s recommended filter the template files just to avoid other data resources.

  You can filter the type of data resources by, first, clicking on Filter icon (See Figure 7). A dialog box will appear. Select filter by: Type Name, the operator Equal and type Template in the input text. Click in OK button. By doing it only the template files will be shown among the other platform data resources.

## 3	Uploading Process

### 3.1	Data Uploader page

•	After login, go right corner, click on user icon and select Data Uploader (See figure 3).

•	You will be presented to several options of data upload (Figure 8). This version of the user guide will cover and explain the upload process of **Climate (Environmental), MCPD (Germplasm material) and Trials data**. The foundation of upload process is the same for every data type, but there are some details that will be observed.

•	The upload system has a data checking feature that will analyze your data searching for missing or incorrect data considering the templates requirements.

•	Sometimes, the files to be uploaded have a huge amount of information and are big file sized. The Germinate platform is prepared to deal with it by uploading and checking data in the background without blocking or interrupting the user interaction.

  <div>
### 3.2	 The Download/Upload Asynchronous Bar
Certain importations using Germinate might require a few minutes to complete, especially since some datasets contain millions of genetic markers and hundreds of thousands of germplasm entries. The asynchronous downloads/uploads, allows you to submit a data request and continue using the platform while the query processes. Once the data is prepared, the interface will notify you eliminating the need to wait idly. You will be familiarized with this side bar since all information about the upload of data will be shown here.
  </div>


</div>




### 3.3	Ex situ Passport Data Upload 

The very first data upload will be the information about the material you used on your experiments. The germplasm information follows the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (MCPD). 
  
•	On uploader page click the MCPD box (Fig. 12).

•	In the bottom of the page an input file element will be available. Select your germplasm data importation file and click on Upload and Check button.


<figure style="text-align:center;">
  <img src="Figure 15 - Uploading MCPD data.png" width="500"/>
  <figcaption>Figure 15 - Uploading MCPD data</figcaption>
</figure>

•	You will notice that you have a selection button to choose between insert new data (default) or in case you need to update information about any germplasm, and knowing the former accession number, you can pick the update option.

•	Click on Upload and Check.

#### 3.3.1	Got an error?

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

  <!-- Image avec légende -->
  <figure style="margin: 0; text-align: center;">
    <img src="Figure 16 - upload status on asynchronous box.png" width="300"/>
    <figcaption style="font-size: small;">Figure 16 - upload status on asynchronous box</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <!-- Texte à côté -->
  <div>
 After uploading your data, the asynchronous box will display the processing status. If an error occurs during the upload, an error message will appear in this box,(`View Feedback`) informing you that there is an issue with the submitted data. 

 You can review the details provided to identify which parts of the template contain incorrect or missing information. This allows you to quickly pinpoint and correct the errors before attempting to upload the data again. If any help is needed you can contact the WP5 team and send the error report (fig. 15) to allow our analyzes.

### 3.4	Trials/Climate Data Upload

On trials upload there is a difference from MCPD. The "Dataset state" indicate the accessibility level of the dataset:

•	**Public** (blue button with an open lock icon): This setting means the dataset is accessible to all users without restrictions.

•	**Private** (blue button with a locked padlock icon): This restricts access to authorized users only, keeping the dataset confidential.

•	**Hidden** (blue button with an eye and strike-through icon): The dataset is concealed from general view and only accessible by specific users or administrators.


Below these options, the green Upload and check button allows you to upload your dataset file and automatically verify its contents for errors or inconsistencies before making it available. The process is the same as MCPD.

## 4	Final considerations

This user guide has introduced the three main templates used for uploading data, each designed to capture specific types of information critical to your project. Ensuring the correctness and completeness of data entered into each template is essential for successful processing and analysis. Carefully review the required fields and adhere to the specified formats to avoid errors during upload.
When uploading your data, use the provided interface tools to submit your files. The system includes validation checks to identify any inconsistencies or missing information, which will be communicated back through error messages or notifications. Pay close attention to these messages and make any necessary corrections before re-uploading.


Following these guidelines will help ensure that your data is accurately incorporated into the COUSIN Germinate platform facilitating smooth workflows and reliable results. Should you encounter any difficulties, refer back to this manual or seek assistance from WP5 project’s representants.
