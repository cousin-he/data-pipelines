# 1. Welcome

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for the **COUSIN project**, focusing on building, deploying, and maintaining **data pipelines** using **Apache Airflow**.

## Objectives
- Automate data workflows for biological datasets.
- Ensure reproducibility and scalability.
- Integrate with machine learning research, including dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques.

::: {.callout-tip}
COUSIN WP5 focuses on infrastructure and data management, where this documentation plays a key role in delivering high-quality data resources.

# 2. Introduction

The **COUSIN Project** aims to improve the automation and management of biological data for similarity search research.  
This documentation serves as a guide for:

- Handling **large biological datasets**.
- Automating preprocessing and analysis workflows.
- Ensuring **reproducibility** of experiments.
- Supporting machine learning models such as **dimensionality reduction** and **clustering**.

Pipelines are orchestrated using **Apache Airflow**, which ensures that every step is executed in the correct order and at the right time.

## Pipeline Architecture Overview

The pipeline used in the COUSIN project is **modular**, meaning each stage is independent but connected through dependencies.

## **High-Level Workflow**

# 3. Data Pipelines in COUSIN

## Overview
The data pipeline automates processes for:
- Data ingestion
- Preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model generation
- Reporting

## Stages of the Pipeline
| Stage                | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Ingestion**        | Load biological datasets from multiple sources. |
| **Preprocessing**    | Clean, normalize, and transform data. |
| **Dimensionality Reduction** | Apply techniques to reduce feature space. |
| **Clustering**       | Group similar data points. |
| **Export & Reporting** | Save processed data and generate outputs. |



# 4. Apache Airflow

## Why Airflow?
Apache Airflow is used for orchestrating workflows, enabling us to:
- Schedule complex tasks
- Manage dependencies
- Monitor pipelines in real time

## Core Concepts
| Concept    | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **DAG**    | Directed Acyclic Graph representing workflow. |
| **Task**   | Individual operation inside a DAG. |
| **Operator** | Template for creating tasks. |
| **Executor** | Defines how tasks are executed (e.g., LocalExecutor). |

## Example DAG
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import datetime

def preprocess():
    print("Preprocessing biological dataset...")

with DAG(
    'cousin_preprocessing',
    start_date=datetime(2025, 1, 1),
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    catchup=False
) as dag:
    task = PythonOperator(
        task_id='preprocess_dataset',
        python_callable=preprocess
    )
```


# 5. Deployment

## Local Deployment with Docker
1. Install Docker and Docker Compose.
2. Create a folder `airflow` with subdirectories:



  airflow/

├─ dags/

├─ logs/

└─ plugins/



3. Start Airflow:
```bash
docker-compose up

```

4. Access the UI at http://localhost:8080
.
