This guide does not cover all features of Germinate. Instead, it provides step-by-step instructions tailored to ensure you can successfully complete the official project’s upload templates with your COUSIN-related datasets and then make it available to the Germinate audience.\nBefore you start, we expect that you are already familiar with concept of Germinate platform and its general purpose regarding COUSIN project targets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in a fully training on Germinate, an official training resource is available here.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOUSIN’s Germinate supports data uploads using specific Excel templates, along with a few options for text-based data templates and even images uploads. Detailed information on how to correctly complete these templates is available within the Data Uploader section, located under the User Advanced Settings menu. This feature (Upload Data) is accessible to users with the appropriate upload permissions . Additionally, a direct link to the templates can be found in the Data Resources link, providing easy access for any user. The templates are store together with other data resources of the project but with this link they are filtered among the others. Users with the Curator role are authorized to upload data into COUSIN’s Germinate platform. However, before gaining upload permissions, interested users must be designated by the project’s work package leaders and complete a training session on the data upload process. The WP5 team is always available to support and assist with data curation and the entire upload process whenever needed, ensuring accurate data management.\n\n\n\n\n• Access https://cousin.ipk-gatersleben.de\n• In the right corner, click in the user icon and then select login (or access the login page directly https://cousin.ipk-gatersleben.de/#/login )\n\n\n\nFigure 1 : To Login page\n\n\n• Enter your login credentials and sign in.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 : Login Page\n\n\n• On right corner again, click on user icon and select Data Uploader (if this option is not available for you it means you are not allowed to upload data, but the templates will be still available check out the next topic).\n\n\n\nFigure 3 - Data uploader menu selection\n\n\n• You will be redirected to the Data Upload page. This will be the page where the files will be submitted after you fill the templates with your data. At this point you just need to click in the link “Data Resources” (see figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4 - To Data resources\n\n\n• On Data resources pages (already filtered by file types Templates) you will have the screen above.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Template files list under data resources\n\n\n• Select your desired template among the Germplasm, Trials or Environment/Climate importation and click on respective Download button to have it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Left Menu, Data Resources\n\n\n\n\nEven being a regular user, you being a regular user, you have access to the Data resources and Templates. The easiest way to access it is through the following URL:\nhttps://cousin.ipk-gatersleben.de/templates\nThis URL will redirect you directly to the importation templates (see Figure 5).\nOther way to reach the templates is by clicking the left menu, Section Data, subpage Data Resources.\nNote that by accessing Data Resources page you will be presented to all type of data resources already available among the project scope. By going this way, the importation templates will be available and you can download it.\nIt’s recommended filter the template files just to avoid other data resources.\nYou can filter the type of data resources by, first, clicking on Filter icon (See Figure 7). A dialog box will appear. Select filter by: Type Name, the operator Equal and type Template in the input text. Click in OK button. By doing it only the template files will be shown among the other platform data resources.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Filtering templates among other data resources\n\n\nIn the next sections the template files you downloaded will be explained and what kind of information you will provide as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this template is to record the passport data of ex situ accessions based on the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptor (MCPD) format. A separate template will soon be available for in situ material. The template has been adapted for the COUSIN project. For compatibility reasons with the underlying Germinate system, there are a number of additional fields for which default values have already been entered.\n• Open the Excel template file you downloaded called germplasm-mcpd-ex-situ.xlsx\n\n\n\nOpen the METADATA sheet. The Metadata sheet will appear in all importation files, not only in the germplasm importation template. You will see three columns: Label (column A), Definition (column B), and Value (column C). The Label and Definition columns are pre-filled, and your task is to enter information into the Value column based on the descriptions.\n\n\n\nOn cell label “Title” (A2), enter a distinct name for your data resource in the corresponding value cell (C2).

If the trials experiment belongs to more than one site/place this information should be informed on separate importation files for each location.\n\n\n\nThis is the full name or identifier of the location or site (Column A).\nExample value: Balruddery Farm\n\n\n\n\nA shorter or abbreviated name for the location or site (Column B).\nExample value: Balruddery\n\n\n\n\nThe two-letter country code representing the country where the location is situated (Column C).\nExample value: GB\n\n\n\n\nThe height above sea level of the location, typically measured in meters (Column D).\nExample value: 110\n\n\n\n\nThe north-south geographic coordinate of the location, given in decimal degrees (Column E).\nExample value: 56.481156\n\n\n\n\nThe east-west geographic coordinate of the location, given in decimal degrees (Column F).\nExample value: -3.1279887\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this template is to record environmental data capturing specific information about the experiment location such as climate, applied treatments, and related contextual variables and event dates.\n\n\n\nFigura 12 - Environmental Data and Variables examples\n\n\n• Open the Excel template file you downloaded called environmental-data.xlsx\n\n\n• Please refer to the Metadata information on MCPD file template. As mentioned before on this guide the Metadata sheet of the templates is the same.\n\n\n\n• Like the traits variables, here you will set the environmental variables. This information belongs to the location. While the traits are related to the accessions, the environment (climate) variables are linked to the location.\n\n\n\nThis is the full name or identifier of the environment variable used in the experiment. It typically uniquely identifies each enviroment variable (Column A).\nExample value: Longterm Mean of Temperature\n\n\n\n\nA shorter or abbreviated name for the environment variable, useful for compact display or referencing (Column B).\nExample value: long_mean_temp\n\n\n\n\nA detailed explanation of what the environmental variable represents or measures in the experiment (Column C).\nExample value: Average temperature over multiple years at the location.\n\n\n\n\nThe type of data the phenotype variable holds, such as date, numeric or categorical – domain like (Column D).\nExample value: numeric\n\n\n\n\nThe full name of the unit of measurement for the variable, if applicable.

From column C and beyond you should enter your variables.\n\n\n\nThe identifier or name of the location of the study. (Column A)\nExample value: Balruddery\n\n\n\n\nDate the environmental variable was observed, formatted YYYYMMDD (Column B).\nExample value: 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sheet contains information about the environment(location) as a whole. This information is customizable and will set the data for all entries observed. Same approach as Trials attribute sheet.\n\n\n\n\nThis sheet has the information about the location where the experiment occurred. This information is mandatory (Location name). Same approach as Trials attribute sheet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• After login, go right corner, click on user icon and select Data Uploader (See figure 3).\n• You will be presented to several options of data upload (Figure 8). This version of the user guide will cover and explain the upload process of Climate (Environmental), MCPD (Germplasm material) and Trials data. The foundation of upload process is the same for every data type, but there are some details that will be observed.\n• The upload system has a data checking feature that will analyze your data searching for missing or incorrect data considering the templates requirements.\n• Sometimes, the files to be uploaded have a huge amount of information and are big file sized. The Germinate platform is prepared to deal with it by uploading and checking data in the background without blocking or interrupting the user interaction.\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Data upload options on Germinate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Asynchronous bar view.png\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain importations using Germinate might require a few minutes to complete, especially since some datasets contain millions of genetic markers and hundreds of thousands of germplasm entries. The asynchronous downloads/uploads, allows you to submit a data request and continue using the platform while the query processes. Once the data is prepared, the interface will notify you eliminating the need to wait idly. You will be familiarized with this side bar since all information about the upload of data will be shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe very first data upload will be the information about the material you used on your experiments. The germplasm information follows the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (MCPD).\n• On uploader page click the MCPD box (Fig. 12).\n• In the bottom of the page an input file element will be available. Select your germplasm data importation file and click on Upload and Check button.\n\n\n\nFigure 15 - Uploading MCPD data\n\n\n• You will notice that you have a selection button to choose between insert new data (default) or in case you need to update information about any germplasm, and knowing the former accession number, you can pick the update option.\n• Click on Upload and Check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16 - upload status on asynchronous box\n\n\n\n\nAfter uploading your data, the asynchronous box will display the processing status. If an error occurs during the upload, an error message will appear in this box,(View Feedback) informing you that there is an issue with the submitted data.\nYou can review the details provided to identify which parts of the template contain incorrect or missing information. This allows you to quickly pinpoint and correct the errors before attempting to upload the data again. If any help is needed you can contact the WP5 team and send the error report (fig. 15) to allow our analyzes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17 - Error report visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn trials upload there is a difference from MCPD. The “Dataset state” indicate the accessibility level of the dataset:\n• Public (blue button with an open lock icon): This setting means the dataset is accessible to all users without restrictions.\n• Private (blue button with a locked padlock icon): This restricts access to authorized users only, keeping the dataset confidential.\n• Hidden (blue button with an eye and strike-through icon): The dataset is concealed from general view and only accessible by specific users or administrators.\nBelow these options, the green Upload and check button allows you to upload your dataset file and automatically verify its contents for errors or inconsistencies before making it available. The process is the same as MCPD.\n\n\n\n\nThis user guide has introduced the three main templates used for uploading data, each designed to capture specific types of information critical to your project. Ensuring the correctness and completeness of data entered into each template is essential for successful processing and analysis. Carefully review the required fields and adhere to the specified formats to avoid errors during upload. When uploading your data, use the provided interface tools to submit your files. The system includes validation checks to identify any inconsistencies or missing information, which will be communicated back through error messages or notifications. Pay close attention to these messages and make any necessary corrections before re-uploading.\nFollowing these guidelines will help ensure that your data is accurately incorporated into the COUSIN Germinate platform facilitating smooth workflows and reliable results. Should you encounter any difficulties, refer back to this manual or seek assistance from WP5 project’s representants."

Detailed information on how to correctly complete these templates is available within the Data Uploader section, located under the User Advanced Settings menu. This feature (Upload Data) is accessible to users with the appropriate upload permissions . Additionally, a direct link to the templates can be found in the Data Resources link, providing easy access for any user. The templates are store together with other data resources of the project but with this link they are filtered among the others. Users with the Curator role are authorized to upload data into COUSIN’s Germinate platform. However, before gaining upload permissions, interested users must be designated by the project’s work package leaders and complete a training session on the data upload process.

You will find on this sheet the same information as presented here above covering the Multi Crop Passport Data entries. This sheet will not receive any data, is just for user reference.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this template is recording standardized plant trial information alongside measurements and other important data for plant material (accessions) used in the trial.\n• Open the excel template file you downloaded called trials-data.xlsx\n\n\n• Please refer to the Metadata information on MCPD file template. As mentioned before on this guide the Metadata sheet of the templates is the same.\n\n\n\n\n• Here is the sheet where you register the trait variables (phenotypes) that you are observing\n\n\n\nFigure 9 - Phenotypes sheet of Trials\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the full name or identifier of the trait variable used in the experiment. It typically uniquely identifies each trait (Column A).\nExample value: Plant height\n\n\n\n\nA shorter or abbreviated name for the phenotype variable, useful for compact display or referencing (Column B).\nExample value: PH\n\n\n\n\nA detailed explanation of what the phenotype variable represents or measures in the experiment (Column C).\nExample value: Vertical measurement of a plant from its base to its highest point\n\n\n\n\nThe type of data the phenotype variable holds, such as text, date, numeric or categorical – domain like (Column D).\nExample value: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Type\nDefinition\n\n\n\n\nText\nData representing textual content\n\n\nNumeric\nData representing numbers (integers, decimals, etc.)\n\n\nDate\nData representing points or intervals in time (e.g., date DD-MM-YYYY)\n\n\nCategorical\nData representing distinct groups or categories (e.g., colors: red, green, …)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe full name of the unit of measurement for the variable, if applicable (Column E).\nExample value: centimeter\n\n\n\n\nThe abbreviated symbol for the measurement unit, if applicable (Column F).\nExample value: cm\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information or clarifications about the units used.

It means that if you have a trait with data type categorical and controlled values in a list you must set here the allowed values.\nExample value: Colors of plant pods: “Red, Green, White”…\n\n\n\n\nThe minimum expected or allowed numeric value for the trait. This field is empty if not specified (Column I).\nExample value: 0\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum expected or allowed numeric value for the trait. This field is empty if not specified (Column J).\nExample value: 10\n\n\n\n\nThe number of elements returned for each observation of the trait. This is the trait’s dimensionality. For the project will be using 1 for single-value phenotypes (Column K).\nExample value: 1\n\n\n\n\nIndicates whether the trait is part of a timeseries dataset to be shown on Germinate (boolean-like). (Column L).\nExample value: FALSE\n\n\n\n\n\n• This sheet contains meta data information about the covering whole experiment and applies to every trait (without individual variation values). Inform the attribute name, data type and value (see image below)\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Additional attributes of germplasm\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 - Data sheet of trials\n\n\n• This sheet contains information about the observed trials data. The dynamic content columns start by column K, that means the trials variables from sheet Phenotypes should be listed from column K and then.\n• The most important on this sheet is the usage of accession numbers of registered material (germplasm) on MCPD passport data (column Line/Phenotype).\n\n\n\nThe identifier or name of the genetic line or phenotype under study. Must be an accession number referenced on database/MCPD uploaded data. Mandatory column. (Column A).\nExample value: PI 204305\n\n\n\n\nThe replicate number indicating the repetition of the experimental unit (Column B).\nExample value: 1\n\n\n\n\nThe block number in which the experimental unit is placed (Column C).\nExample value: 2\n\n\n\n\nThe row number of the experimental unit within the block or field layout (Column D).\nExample value: 5\n\n\n\n\nThe column number of the experimental unit within the block or field layout (Column E).\nExample value: 3\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental or specific treatment assigned to this unit (Column F).

Like location is only needed if more than one sites/location was used in the experiment, otherwise just use the sheet Location.\nExample value: 250\n\n\n\n\nVariable: A numeric identifier referring to the specific experiment (Column K). From column K and beyond you will enter your variables and respective values. The variables must be the same stated on Phenotype sheet.\nExample value: EXP 21\n\n\n\n\n\n• This sheet can still blank. In this stage of the project we choose not use the records of observed dates of variables individually on this sheet. The idea is to have the observed dates directly as variables on data sheet and avoid duplication of information.\n\n\n\n\n• This sheet contains information about the trial as a whole. This information is customizable and will set the data for all entries observed. Example: During the trials there was daily irrigation at 8am independent of the other trials measured or a specific treatment.\n\n\n\nThe name or label of the specific characteristic or feature being described (Column A).\nExample value: Irrigation\n\n\n\n\nThe data type describing the kind of information the attribute holds, such as text, numeric, or categorical (Column B).\nExample value: text\n\n\n\n\nThe content or measurement corresponding to the attribute, providing the specific details or data (Column C).\nExample value: Daily irrigation at 8am, 200ml per square metre\n\n\n\n\n\n• This sheet contains information about the owners/creators of the dataset/experiment and all collaborators references.\n\n\n\nLast name (surname) of the author(s), researcher(s), scientist(s), or student(s) responsible for producing the information product (Column A).\nExample value: Rubiales\n\n\n\n\nFirst name (and middle name if available) of the author(s), researcher(s), scientist(s), or student(s) responsible for producing the information product (Column B).\nExample value: Diego\n\n\n\n\nType of contribution of the person to the investigation (e.g., data submitter, author, corresponding author) (Column C).\nExample value: Author\n\n\n\n\nAn identifier for the data submitter.

This information is mandatory (Location name), but just if only one location is recorded. If the trials experiment belongs to more than one site/place this information should be informed on separate importation files for each location.\n\n\n\nThis is the full name or identifier of the location or site (Column A).\nExample value: Balruddery Farm\n\n\n\n\nA shorter or abbreviated name for the location or site (Column B).\nExample value: Balruddery\n\n\n\n\nThe two-letter country code representing the country where the location is situated (Column C).\nExample value: GB\n\n\n\n\nThe height above sea level of the location, typically measured in meters (Column D).\nExample value: 110\n\n\n\n\nThe north-south geographic coordinate of the location, given in decimal degrees (Column E).\nExample value: 56.481156\n\n\n\n\nThe east-west geographic coordinate of the location, given in decimal degrees (Column F).\nExample value: -3.1279887\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this template is to record environmental data capturing specific information about the experiment location such as climate, applied treatments, and related contextual variables and event dates.\n\n\n\nFigura 12 - Environmental Data and Variables examples\n\n\n• Open the Excel template file you downloaded called environmental-data.xlsx\n\n\n• Please refer to the Metadata information on MCPD file template. As mentioned before on this guide the Metadata sheet of the templates is the same.\n\n\n\n• Like the traits variables, here you will set the environmental variables. This information belongs to the location. While the traits are related to the accessions, the environment (climate) variables are linked to the location.\n\n\n\nThis is the full name or identifier of the environment variable used in the experiment. It typically uniquely identifies each enviroment variable (Column A).\nExample value: Longterm Mean of Temperature\n\n\n\n\nA shorter or abbreviated name for the environment variable, useful for compact display or referencing (Column B).\nExample value: long_mean_temp\n\n\n\n\nA detailed explanation of what the environmental variable represents or measures in the experiment (Column C).\nExample value: Average temperature over multiple years at the location.\n\n\n\n\nThe type of data the phenotype variable holds, such as date, numeric or categorical – domain like (Column D).\nExample value: numeric\n\n\n\n\nThe full name of the unit of measurement for the variable, if applicable. (Column E).\nExample value: Celsius\n\n\n\n\nThe abbreviated symbol for the measurement unit, if applicable (Column F).\nExample value: ℃\n\n\n\n\nAdditional information or clarifications about the units used (Column G).\nExample value: Temperature in Celsius.\n\n\n\n\n\n• For the environmental (climate) data you will need to attach the variables to the location and a date of observation (column A and B respectively). From column C and beyond you should enter your variables.\n\n\n\nThe identifier or name of the location of the study. (Column A)\nExample value: Balruddery\n\n\n\n\nDate the environmental variable was observed, formatted YYYYMMDD (Column B).\nExample value: 1\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sheet contains information about the environment(location) as a whole. This information is customizable and will set the data for all entries observed. Same approach as Trials attribute sheet.\n\n\n\n\nThis sheet has the information about the location where the experiment occurred. This information is mandatory (Location name).

    "text": "• After login, go right corner, click on user icon and select Data Uploader (See figure 3).\n• You will be presented to several options of data upload (Figure 8). This version of the user guide will cover and explain the upload process of Climate (Environmental), MCPD (Germplasm material) and Trials data. The foundation of upload process is the same for every data type, but there are some details that will be observed.\n• The upload system has a data checking feature that will analyze your data searching for missing or incorrect data considering the templates requirements.\n• Sometimes, the files to be uploaded have a huge amount of information and are big file sized. The Germinate platform is prepared to deal with it by uploading and checking data in the background without blocking or interrupting the user interaction.\n\n\n\nFigure 13 - Data upload options on Germinate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14 - Asynchronous bar view.png\n\n\n\n\n\nCertain importations using Germinate might require a few minutes to complete, especially since some datasets contain millions of genetic markers and hundreds of thousands of germplasm entries. The asynchronous downloads/uploads, allows you to submit a data request and continue using the platform while the query processes. Once the data is prepared, the interface will notify you eliminating the need to wait idly. You will be familiarized with this side bar since all information about the upload of data will be shown here.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe very first data upload will be the information about the material you used on your experiments. The germplasm information follows the Multi-Crop Passport Descriptors (MCPD).\n• On uploader page click the MCPD box (Fig. 12).\n• In the bottom of the page an input file element will be available. Select your germplasm data importation file and click on Upload and Check button.\n\n\n\nFigure 15 - Uploading MCPD data\n\n\n• You will notice that you have a selection button to choose between insert new data (default) or in case you need to update information about any germplasm, and knowing the former accession number, you can pick the update option.\n• Click on Upload and Check.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16 - upload status on asynchronous box\n\n\n\n\nAfter uploading your data, the asynchronous box will display the processing status. If an error occurs during the upload, an error message will appear in this box,(View Feedback) informing you that there is an issue with the submitted data.\nYou can review the details provided to identify which parts of the template contain incorrect or missing information. This allows you to quickly pinpoint and correct the errors before attempting to upload the data again. If any help is needed you can contact the WP5 team and send the error report (fig. 15) to allow our analyzes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17 - Error report visualization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn trials upload there is a difference from MCPD. The “Dataset state” indicate the accessibility level of the dataset:\n• Public (blue button with an open lock icon): This setting means the dataset is accessible to all users without restrictions.\n• Private (blue button with a locked padlock icon): This restricts access to authorized users only, keeping the dataset confidential.\n• Hidden (blue button with an eye and strike-through icon): The dataset is concealed from general view and only accessible by specific users or administrators.\nBelow these options, the green Upload and check button allows you to upload your dataset file and automatically verify its contents for errors or inconsistencies before making it available. The process is the same as MCPD."

Ensuring the correctness and completeness of data entered into each template is essential for successful processing and analysis. Carefully review the required fields and adhere to the specified formats to avoid errors during upload. When uploading your data, use the provided interface tools to submit your files. The system includes validation checks to identify any inconsistencies or missing information, which will be communicated back through error messages or notifications. Pay close attention to these messages and make any necessary corrections before re-uploading.\nFollowing these guidelines will help ensure that your data is accurately incorporated into the COUSIN Germinate platform facilitating smooth workflows and reliable results.
